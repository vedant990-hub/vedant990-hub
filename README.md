## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Computer Science student (Class of 2028)** based in **India**, focused on developing **production-ready web applications** rather than experimental demos.

My primary stack revolves around **Next.js and React**, with an emphasis on **performance, SEO, clean architecture, and deployment workflows**. I enjoy taking projects from idea → implementation → live deployment, and refining them until they’re actually usable.

I value **clarity over complexity** and **execution over hype**.

---

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- Building **SEO-optimized, performant Next.js websites**
- Migrating and refactoring existing React projects
- Clean UI implementation with modern tooling
- Practical integrations (analytics, forms, deployments)
- Writing code meant to be **maintained**, not abandoned

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages**
- JavaScript  
- Python  
- SQL  
- C++

**Frontend**
- React  
- Next.js  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Three.js (when visuals actually add value)

**Tools & Workflow**
- Git & GitHub  
- Vercel / Netlify  
- REST APIs  
- Basic database usage (project-dependent)

---

## 🚀 Selected Work

I keep my repositories focused and intentional.  
Pinned projects typically represent:

- Client-facing, deployed websites  
- Next.js applications with SEO and performance considerations  
- Structured projects with real configuration and documentation  

> If a project doesn’t solve a real problem or reach deployment, it doesn’t stay pinned.
